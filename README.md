# MultilayerEcoNet
The architecture of Multilayer Ecological Networks

All computational analysis was made using Python 3.10.8 running in  a Linux desktop (version 22). Dependencies are listed at the begining of each file.
python3_enviroment contains the requirements.txt and enviroment_droplet.yml files needed to recreate a python environment with all libraries adn dependencies needed.

1- FullCode.ipynb is a notebook that contains most of the results shown in the main manuscript and in the Suplementary Information. The functions used are stored in FullCodeFunctions.py.
2- The folder *data* contains the data used and a small testing dataset that can be used to run tests, created using create_syntetic_data.ipynb.
3- Two very resource consuming plots have been separated from the rest. They are in the folder MFENplot, wchich contains two python scripts to depict the Multifunctional Ecological Network and a third one with the functions used in both.
