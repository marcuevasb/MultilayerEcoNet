# MultilayerEcoNet
The architecture of Multilayer Ecological Networks

All computational analysis was made using Python 3.10.8 running in  a Linux desktop (version 22). Dependencies are listed at the begining of each file.

1. FullCode.py : is the python code which contains the complete computational analysis
2. FullCodeFunctions.py : contains some functions needed to run FullCode.py
3. PlotMultigraph.py : is an independent python code used to generate the Multilayer Network plot
4. PlotMultigraphFunctions.py; contains some functions needed to run PlotMultigraph.py
